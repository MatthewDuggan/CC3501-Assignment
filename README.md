# CC3501-Assignment

-The code run on the Pi is in IMURecordingV2

-The "Code" folder has the Kinetis project used for the breadboard implementation

-"DugganPhilpLarsenCC3501Assignment" has all the Altium files

-"Matlab Serial Plotter" has the script which plots the 3 Euler angles via the serial data, which would have ideally been converted into something that could run on the Pi & use the BT data
