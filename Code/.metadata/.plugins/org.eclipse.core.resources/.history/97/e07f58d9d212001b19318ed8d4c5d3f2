Module "Term"      (component Term)
   - Term_CRLF -Send CRLF to terminal.
   - Term_SendStr -Send string to terminal.
   - Term_SendNum -Send number to terminal.
   - Term_SendChar -Send char to terminal.
   - Term_Cls -Clear the terminal window.
   - Term_MoveTo -Move cursor to position x, y. Range of coordinates can be from 1 to the size, which depends on the used 
                terminal. Position [1,1] represents the upper left corner.
   - Term_ReadChar -Read char from terminal.
   - Term_KeyPressed -Test if char was received from the terminal.

Module "BTUART"    (component AsynchroSerial)
   - BTUART_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does 
                not wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the 
                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the 
                information about an exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be 
                read.
   - BTUART_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - BTUART_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the 
                receiver property is enabled.
   - BTUART_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

Module "I2C"       (component InternalI2C)
   - I2C_SendChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address 
                bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes one character (byte) to the bus. The slave 
                address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" method or in the component 
                initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and the method 
                returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The state of transmission is obtainable from 
                (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost) events.   When working as a SLAVE, this method writes a character to 
                the internal output slave buffer and, after the master starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no 
                character is ready for a transmission (internal output slave buffer is empty), the Empty character will be sent 
                (see "Empty character" property).
   - I2C_RecvChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address 
                bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus, then reads one character (byte) from the bus and then sends the 
                stop condition. The slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" method or 
                in component initialization section, property "Target slave address init". If interrupt service is enabled and 
                the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was finished successfully. The state of 
                transmission must be tested by means of events (OnReceiveData, OnError or OnArbitLost). In case of successful 
                transmission, received data is ready after OnReceiveData event is called.   When working as a SLAVE, this 
                method reads a character from the input slave buffer.
   - I2C_SendBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the bus. The 
                slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SlaveSelect10" method or in component 
                initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and the method 
                returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The state of transmission is detectable by 
                means of events (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost). Data to be send is not copied to an internal buffer 
                and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer should not be changed until the 
                transmission is complete. Event OnTransmitData can be used to detect the end of the transmission.  When working 
                as a SLAVE, this method writes a block of characters to the internal output slave buffer and then, after the 
                master starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no character is ready for a transmission (internal output 
                slave buffer is empty), the "Empty character" will be sent (see "Empty character" property). In SLAVE mode the 
                data are copied to an internal buffer, if specified by "Output buffer size" property.
   - I2C_RecvBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus, then reads the block of characters from the bus and then 
                sends the stop condition. The slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" 
                method or in component initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is 
                enabled and the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was finished successfully. The state 
                of transmission must be tested by means of events (OnReceiveData, OnError or OnArbitLost). In case of 
                successful transmission, received data is ready after OnReceiveData event is called.   When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads a block of characters from the input slave buffer.
   - I2C_SelectSlave -This method selects a new slave for communication by its 7-bit slave address value. Any send or receive 
                method directs to or from selected device, until a new slave device is selected by this method. This method is 
                not available for the SLAVE mode.
